## Description

Pierre was so pleased with your console app for his bakery that he wants to hire you for a new project. This time, he would like you to build him an MVC application to help him track the vendors that purchase baked goods from him and the orders belonging to those vendors.

For example, Pierre might supply croissants to a vendor called "Suzie's Cafe" once a week. Pierre may want to create a new Vendor to represent the cafe and add new Orders to it to help keep track of his expanding business relationships.
